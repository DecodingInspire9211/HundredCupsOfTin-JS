## Reflection
### **What went well?**
- **Art Design:** I am surprised about the Art inside the game, on which i just spent a maximum of 3 hours.
- **Scene Management:** Despite the fact that it probably wasn't that needed, I am happy with how you can switch between the scenes. It would definetly be useful if I decide to continue working on this game.
- **Audio Management:** I also am happy with how the Audio Manager turned out to be. I decided to write one, because the simplest approach rarely worked.

### Challenges

- **Time Management:** Despite the fact I had two weeks, i managed to waste two days on rather useless thigns. First day was my so-called "day of the plan", where I laid out my roadmap for the project and rewriting my already existing template from TypeScript to JavaScript. In addition to planning out, i already created the Main Menu Scene and an empty Game Scene. Day Two, was me rewriting the same stuff into TypeScript again and trying to implement a game grid. Day Three was fully wasting my time with the game grid.
- **Bug fixes:** Collisions slowing down the whole browser to Scenes overlapping like wild. From Audio acting like a madman to the game not even displaying anymore. Bugs have definetly kept me "entertained".

### Lessons Learned
- **Scope:** Despite having reduced my scope already. I still overestimated the time I had for this project. I should have started with the most important things first and then work my way down to the least important things. And I had to simplify a lot of things in order to stay in time.
- **Discussions:** It was a random idea of mine but around a certain time each day, I shortly wandered around and discussed other peoples games and my own game with other people. This actually helped my development progress in some way.
