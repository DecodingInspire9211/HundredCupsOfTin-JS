Intro

The year is 1968. You take on the role of Knox Janacek, a young canine embarking on a new chapter of life in the fictional town of Raudsborough,
nestled within the Principality of Zinnfelden.
Seeking a fresh start, you arrive with dreams of a better future.

While exploring the town, you come across a vacant storefront available for rent. Intrigued, you decide to contact the owner.

The owner, an elderly and frail individual, reveals that he intends to sell the storefront. With no family to inherit it, he proposes a deal: he
will rent the space to you, but with specific conditions:

You must double the amount of money you start with.
If you go bankrupt, however, you will be forced to leave.
Eager to take the chance, you accept his terms and are handed the keys.
Your stage has been set â€” soo, what are you waiting for?
